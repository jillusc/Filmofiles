## Design

The site's design was based on supporting the theme and the experience of film-watching.

### Colour

The colour scheme could be described as deep and rich as it features a charcoal grey and a dark teal colour; accent colours are a vibrant orange-red and golden yellow. The colours were chosen to emulate the sense of being in a cinema, with subdued lighting and heavy, plush velvet curtains and seats. There is therefore a strong contrast between the background colours and accents, and the bright red text headings have a background shadow effect, resembling artificial light in the darkness.

### Imagery

A static image on the home page site depicts ... In the review cards, a placeholder image of cinema tickets and a bag of popcorn furthers the association with the cinema-going experience to appeal to the users and reinforce the theme of the site. The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by users with each film review submission.

### Typography

Two fonts were imported from Goole Fonts: Workbench for the Filmofiles logo and Montserrat for the headings. The remaining text across the site uses the Helvetica Neue font. Workbench has a somewhat grainy character with horizontal streaks running through it, making the logo reminiscent of an old VHS label and thus tying in another medium of film-watching.

## Agile Methodology

The Projects functionality in Github was used to manage the process of creating the site using an Agile approach, with a kanban board for tracking the progress and completion of User Stories.
Github Issues were created for each User Story with defined acceptance criteria to make the execution as straightforward as possible.

## Data Models

The principles of Object-Oriented Programming and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views were used throughout this project:

AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.
The custom model, Film,  ... A ... can only have one user and one ... and is therefore linked to the User and ... models through foreign keys.
The second custom model, Review, was implementedn order for users to submit reviews . The review's author is a ForeignKey to the User model given a recipe can only have one author...
The other custom model, Comment, allows users to comment on a review and ... is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one recipe.

The the database schema are illustrated by the diagram below:
