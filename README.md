# Filmofiles

Filmofiles is a film review app designed to encourage movie fans to come together and share their opinions. The app is targeted towards users who wish to contribute to and engage in discourse with other like-minded individuals: users can browse and select other users' contributions to read, and, having completed a simple registration process, can post comments as well as submit their own film reviews.<br>

## Design

The site's design was based on supporting the theme and the experience of film-watching.

### Colour

The colour scheme could be described as deep and rich as it features a charcoal grey and a dark teal colour; accent colours are a vibrant orange-red, golden yellow and cornflower blue. The colours were chosen to emulate the sense of being in a cinema, with subdued lighting and heavy, plush velvet curtains and seats. There is therefore a strong contrast between the background colours and accents, and the bright red text headings have a background shadow effect, resembling artificial light in the darkness.

### Imagery
A static image on the home page in monochrome depicts a view of an empty cinema from the perspective of a viewer looking towards the screen.<br>
<img src="README images/movie-theater-4609877_1920.webp">

In the review cards, a placeholder image of cinema tickets and a bag of popcorn furthers the association with the cinema-going experience to appeal to the users and reinforce the theme of the site.<br>
<img src="README images/popcorn-898154_1280.png">

The rest of the imagery is in the form of the individual film covers.

### Typography

The site uses just two fonts, imported from Goole Fonts: Workbench for the Filmofiles logo and Montserrat for the remaining text. Workbench has a somewhat grainy character with horizontal streaks running through it, making the logo reminiscent of an old VHS label and thus tying in another medium of film-watching.

## Agile Methodology

The Projects functionality in Github was used to manage the process of creating the site using an Agile approach, with a kanban board for tracking the progress and completion of User Stories. Github Issues were created for each User Story with defined acceptance criteria to make the execution as straightforward as possible.


## Data Models

This project follows Object-Oriented Programming principles and employs Django's Class-Based Generic Views. It includes three custom models: Film, representing film details (title, director, genre, year, image); Review, for film reviews with one-to-many relationships to the User & Film models and an implicit many-to-many relationship with the Comment model; and Comment with one-to-many relationships to User and Review models, which allows users to post comments on reviews.

The database schema are illustrated by the ERD diagram below:
